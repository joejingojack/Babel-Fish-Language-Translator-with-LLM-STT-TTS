Welcome to this guided project about creating a voice translation assistant using watsonx and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. 

The guided project takes you through building a translation assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to watsonx's flan-ul2 model, receive a response in other languages, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. 

The voice translator will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.
